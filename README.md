# Neuromap.app

## Design

- This project utilizes React.js Hooks and Reducers to provide a seemless canvas for "Idea" manipulation.
- The API is produced in Java using Spring Boot to interface with a MySQL Database.
- The project tasks were established on a Kanban board.
- Utilizing Pull Requests and code review promoted clean code and best practices.
- Uses responsive CSS for layout, as well as personal customization

## Why is the project built this way

- While designing this project with the guidance of a Senior Software Engineer, we decided to utilize Reacts `useState` to provide state handling.
- This was later upgraded with `useReducer` as the next step in state management.
- With Java being my most established language, Spring Boot was the final decision for producing my API.
- MySQL was chosen as the database because it was the version I had the most experience with.
- Much of the project was produced step by step as a way for my mentor to introduce concepts and design choices.

## Next Steps

- The current goal is to begin transitioning portions of the project for utilization of AWS services.
- Provide CSS that allows for improved usage on phones/tablets
- Produce Peer to Peer collaboration for a Map.
- Implement users and varying Map instances between different users.
- Add brainstorming templates such as lists and trees.

### Personalization of CSS as well as dynamic idea placement

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
